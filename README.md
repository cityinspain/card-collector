# card-collector

an application to manage your card collection (very early stages of development)

in the future, the intent is to allow users to organize, categorize, and track value of their cards. eventually, users will also be able to sell cards 
through the platform.

## to do

* create a "detail" page for a card, where data such as player, year, set, etc. can be input.
* create a list page, showing the users card collection
* set up filtering options for the list page
